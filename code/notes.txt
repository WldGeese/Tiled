New Tileset - Browse - grab your image with all your Tileset
    Make sure the tile width and tile height on the tileset is equal to the tile width and tile height of your map (in upper left corner)
    
Random Mode (D)
    Select multiple tiles from your tileset and click Random Mode (D)
        Now as you draw it will pull randomly from your selection
        To change the probability items in random mode, go to the tab with the tileset on it, click on specific item(s)
        and change the probability in the top left

Objects
    These are things you can place on the map, can be any size, and you can place them wherever you want
        Not bound by tilesize
    Import by clicking on New Tileset in the bottom right and changing the Type to collection of images and naming it
        This will create a new tab and you can drag imagines into the tab
            The objects will all look like they are the same size but they're not necessarily
    Create an Object layer
    Use the Insert Tile (T) button and then you can place objects
    Double click on objects to be able to rotate or resize
    In the Objects tab in upper right you can select individual objects that way and rename, set class (aka type), and see stats
    Use Select Objects (S) to select individual objects, or click drag to select multiple
    **Once you change the name of an object you'll see this relfected over it's head and also in the tab on the right
    You can go to View and hide the names from the actual map, or only show selected

Shapes
    Next to Insert Object you can also insert points, polygons, ellipses, etc
        You can't really import these into your code since they don't have rects, but you can instead import their geometry, so their x,y, etc
            * This can be really useful for checking to see if the player enters a certain area, etc

Text
    You can add text to the screen but hard to import into pygame, so similar story to Shapes

Terrains
    Special tiles that react to their surroundings (in 3 different ways):
        1. Corners
            Check the corners
            If a tile's corners borders certain things, then it connects this tile and the tile next to it
        2. Edges
            Check the Edges
            If the tile's right edge borders a tile with the same thing on its left edge, then it connects the two tiles
        3. Corners + Edges
            Checks corners and edges
            So if bottom right corner, right edge, and top right corner all match the corresponding left corners and left edge of next tile, then the two tiles are linked
                This is the most complex and takes forever

Creating Terrains
    Open tab for the tileset you're working with
    Click the terrain set icon at top of screen (looks like map of beach)
        This will pop up a new section on the right of the screen
        Click the blue plus sign under that section and then check which kind of set you want to make (corner, edge, mix)
            Rename the terrain set in the upper right
                Then name the red triangle underneath that
        
    Assuming you chose edge, now click on the red thing, and then click tiles on every edge where you want to check for connection

    If you've got multiple different times of art connections on your tiles, you may need to create two terrains, meaning two red triangle thingies


Using Terrains
    Now back on the map, you'll see a tab in bottom right for terrain sets
        Make sure you consider creating a new layer or be conscious of what layer you want this terrain on
        With that terrain brush selected (the beach map looking one), you can now paint on those objects without 
        selecting tiles individually and it will dynamically render what it's supposed to look like
    * If you have two terrain chunks that connect the exact same but look different, Tiled will randomly choose one of 
    them each time the requirements are multiple
        So if you're using edges and you've got a rounded circle and a small square that both meet the 
        adjacent tiles in the same places, it'll go between the two randomly
            You can also modify the probability of those two tiles like we did before to influence how often each is placed

    ** If you're working with multiple terrain connections in a terrain set, you may need to place seed tiles so that Tiled
    knows what to start with
        Make sure you choose the seed tiles from the terrain set itself

    If you click on the Patterns tab on the Terrain, you can see all the patterns that Tiled needs you to specify in order to
    have a complete set. The ones you have not specified yet will be highlighted, used ones will be faded


Exporting from Tiled to pygame (if you're trying to change the file type. If not, think you can just use the tmx file you already have)
    On map, File/Export As
        Consider making a folder called Export in your game directory to save these things
        Save as Tiled map file (*.tmx)

    You could instead Export as Image to export the entire map as an image
        Could do that for the floor if you've just got one floor for the whole game, but could also use tmx data

Isometric Tiles (1:11 mark)
    Will have to choose an Isometric Orientation when you create new map

Importing Tiled into pygame
    2 ways:
        1. Manually using csv/json data (not recommended)
        2. Use pytmx
            *"from pytmx.util_pygame import load_pygame"

Basic idea of how he recommends using this in pygame:
    Create a Tile sprite class that takes an x,y,surf,group
    Create a sprite group
    Iterate through the tile layers of the map, get the x,y,surf for each tile and use that to create an instance of your Tile class
        Remember to multiple the x and y by the cell width and height, respectively
    When you call your sprite class.draw(screen), you should then see the map
