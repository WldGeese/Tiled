New Tileset - Browse - grab your image with all your Tileset
    Make sure the tile width and tile height on the tileset is equal to the tile width and tile height of your map (in upper left corner)
    
Random Mode (D)
    Select multiple tiles from your tileset and click Random Mode (D)
        Now as you draw it will pull randomly from your selection
        To change the probability items in random mode, go to the tab with the tileset on it, click on specific item(s)
        and change the probability in the top left

Objects
    These are things you can place on the map, can be any size, and you can place them wherever you want
        Not bound by tilesize
    Import by clicking on New Tileset in the bottom right and changing the Type to collection of images and naming it
        This will create a new tab and you can drag imagines into the tab
            The objects will all look like they are the same size but they're not necessarily
    Create an Object layer
    Use the Insert Tile (T) button and then you can place objects
    Double click on objects to be able to rotate or resize
    In the Objects tab in upper right you can select individual objects that way and rename, set class (aka type), and see stats
    Use Select Objects (S) to select individual objects, or click drag to select multiple
    **Once you change the name of an object you'll see this relfected over it's head and also in the tab on the right
    You can go to View and hide the names from the actual map, or only show selected

Shapes
    Next to Insert Object you can also insert points, polygons, ellipses, etc
        You can't really import these into your code since they don't have rects, but you can instead import their geometry, so their x,y, etc
            * This can be really useful for checking to see if the player enters a certain area, etc

Text
    You can add text to the screen but hard to import into pygame, so similar story to Shapes

Terrains
    Special tiles that react to their surroundings (in 3 different ways):
        1. Corners
            Check the corners
            If a tile's corners borders certain things, then it connects this tile and the tile next to it
        2. Edges
            Check the Edges
            If the tile's right edge borders a tile with the same thing on its left edge, then it connects the two tiles
        3. Corners + Edges
            Checks corners and edges
            So if bottom right corner, right edge, and top right corner all match the corresponding left corners and left edge of next tile, then the two tiles are linked
                This is the most complex and takes forever
